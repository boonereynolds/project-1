#Project 1: Simon Says
###Introduction

By the end of this project, I will have created a Simon Says game using technical skills learned during the first 2 weeks of WDI. I will use HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and jQuery to deliver to a delightful web-based Simon Says game.
	
###Approach
This project will use CSS to style the web page and jQuery to manipulate the HTML file to make the page give the user a sequence of buttons to press based on randomized computer choices.
